However, if you aren't plugged into Ableton, the arrow keys won't be enabled. To fake being in Ableton, send the system exclusive stream "F0 26 65 01 11 02 F7".
As a public service, I'll talk about some of the codes it sends.
The device has 64 pads with LEDs under them, which can light up in different colors if you send note-ons to them with different velocities. Sending Channel 0 and the note number addresses the pad, velocity in groups of 16 sets the colors:
black (0-15) , white (16-31), yellow (32-47), aqua (48-63), purple (64-79), blue (80-95), green (96-111), red (112-127)
Once set, they have to have a note-off (any velocity) sent to it to reset it otherwise they ignore new colors sent to them.
Sending on other channels is more primitive, it just makes anything on channel 2 blue, anything on channel 3 green.

In "Clip" mode, and the top left hand button active, the top row will send Channel 1 note on 0 through note on 7, with velocity of 127. Releasing the pad sends a corresponding note off, velocity 0 . The Next row down sends note on 16-23, and so on. The way you get to note ons 8-15 is by "scrolling" over with the arrow keys at the bottom, so by tapping the right arrow 8 times, you get to the missing 64 codes.

Similarly the knobs are Channel 1 CC 0 to 7 and scroll over just like the pads do to get to cc 8-15.
The down arrow will also reassign the knobs to the next bank of CC's (16..31) etc. And the down arrow affects the pads by revealing new rows as well, on channel 5.
The row of buttons on the right side sends Channel 3 note on 112 -119 and continue going to 127 via the down button.
Mode 1 divides it into two wide columns, sending on channel 2 , mapped like this pretty good for a melodic instrument.
80 81 82 83 | 48 49 50 51
76 77 78 79 | 44 45 46 47
72 73 74 75 | 40 41 42 43
68 69 70 71 | 36 37 38 39
64 65 66 67 | 32 33 34 35
60 61 62 63 | 28 29 30 31
56 57 58 59 | 24 25 26 27
52 53 54 55 | 20 21 22 23
Mode 2 is a little too complicated to describe here... it might only make sense to Ableton.
Set Mode treats the pads as presets for the knobs (which you can further tweak by turning them). The left-right arrows can set other CC's, and the first four buttons on the left will change to the next bank of 16 CC's: pretty nice!
